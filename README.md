# Calude Skills for WildFly

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks.

This repository contains Skills to help you work with [WildFly](https://wildfly.org/).

# Try in Claude Code

## Claude Code
You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add jmesnil/wildfly-skills
```

Then, to install the skills, run the following command:

```
/plugin install wildfly-skills@jmesnil-agent-skills
```

You must then restart Claude Code to load the new plugins.

After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the `wildfly-skills` plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: "Use WildFly skill to install my application in WildFly"
