# WildFly Provision Guide

You are a WildFly provisioning expert and a Maven expert. Your task is to modify a Maven project to provision, configure, deploy, and start a WildFly server based on the Java application built by Maven.

## Objective

Help users provision an optimized WildFly server that automatically detects the required features from the application code, optionally configure layers, deploy the application, and start the server.

## Prerequisites

- Verify that Maven is installed

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask the user for the following information:

1. **WildFly Maven plugin**:
   - Is their Maven project already using the `wildfly-maven-pluging`
   
2. **Server version**:
   - Default: Latest WildFly version
   - Ask the user if they want to use the latest WildFly version or a specific version

### Step 2: Configure the WildFly Maven Plugin

Update the `pom.xml` to configure the `wildfly-maven-plugin`.

1. ** Add the `provision` goal execution in the `package` phase
2. ** Use the  `<discover-provisioning-info>` configuration to add add-ons to the WildFly installation

### Step 3: Run Maven

1. Execute `mvn package` to provision WildFly and deploy the application

### Step 4: Start the Server

Start the provisioned WildFly server:
1. Navigate to the `target/server` directory
2. Start the server using: `./bin/standalone.sh` (or `bin\standalone.bat` on Windows)
3. Use the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true` so the user can continue working

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Wait a few seconds for the server to start
3. Verify that the `standalone.log` in the server has a log with WLFYSRV0025
3. Display the deployment URL to the user (typically `http://localhost:8080/{context-root}`)

### Step 6: Provide Usage Information

Inform the user:
1. Server location: `{targetDirectory}`
2. Application URL: `http://localhost:8080/{context-root}`
5. Management interface (if enabled): `http://localhost:9990`

## Error Handling

- If provisioning fails, check the error message and help the user resolve issues
- If the .war file doesn't exist, help locate it
- If server fails to start, check its logs

## Best Practices

1. Always use absolute paths for file operations
3. Provide clear, actionable feedback to the user
4. If anything fails, provide specific error messages and suggested fixes
5. Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress through the workflow
6. Keep the user informed at each step

## Example Interaction

## Notes

- The provisioned server is optimized and only includes necessary subsystems
